## Versioning Scheme

_(This is pretty simple standard stuff, but since Carson's never really done much with it, he's gonna leave this here for reference)_

**v1.2.3**

- **v** Prefix releases with this for consistency.
- **1** Major release with breaking changes.
  - Use for major backend reworks, changes in the multiplexer, or major additions such as a web API.
- **2** Minor release with additional non-breaking functionality.
  - Use for new commands, or major feature upgrades to existing commands that are worth dedicating a seperate version to
- **3** Patch release involving bug fixes.
  - Should probably wait until a hand-full of fixes have been implemented before tagging a release, unless the fixes need released ASAP.
